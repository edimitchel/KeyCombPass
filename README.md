KeyCombPass
===========

A new way to reach a hidden page : request a password anonymously in a page with a combo of letter..



## Test page ##

The test page request the pass 'aBd'. The user must press : 'a', 'Shift+b', and 'd'.


## TODO ##

* Set other type where it could request all the keyboard touch (with keyCode/which)
* Improve the security (hide the pass in script and secure the execution of method)
